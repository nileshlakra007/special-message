        <h1>A Special Message for You</h1>
        <p>Dear Shiwangi,</p>
        <p>I watched <i>The Age of Adaline</i>, and it brought back memories of how our paths first crossed on that trip to Triund. I remember catching glimpses of your smile and wanting to talk to you, but life seemed to have other plans. Whether it was the bustle of the trek or just bad timing, I missed a lot of chances to really get to know you. But I’m so grateful that despite those missed opportunities, we’ve found our way to each other now.</p>
        <p>Watching the movie reminded me of the beautiful unpredictability of life, much like the way destiny brought us together. I don’t want to miss this chance we have, and I promise you won’t regret giving this a try. I won’t disappoint you—I’m committed to making this journey with you something special.</p>
        <p>As a token of how much our conversations and your adventurous spirit mean to me, I wanted to give you something thoughtful. <i>The Alchemist</i> is a book about following your personal legend, much like how we are both navigating our own paths. I hope it inspires you as much as it has inspired me, reminding you that the journey is just as important as the destination.</p>
        <p>The evil eye bracelet is my way of wishing you protection and good fortune on all the adventures you still have ahead of you. It’s a small symbol, but like the meteor in Adaline’s story, I hope it brings a positive impact to your life in ways you might not expect.</p>
        <p>Thank you for taking a chance on us, despite the age difference and everything else. I’m so grateful that you chose to explore this path with me. I can’t wait to see where our journey leads us next, and I’m looking forward to continuing our conversation about destiny, time, and all the wonderful unknowns that lie ahead.</p>
        <p>With heartfelt admiration,<br>Nilesh</p>
